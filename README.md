> Haetae has a high degree of wisdom, knows people and human nature. It can distinguish right from wrong, knows good from evil, loyalty and treachery. When it finds out the officials who commit treachery, it knocks him down with its horn and eats him down. It can distinguish between right and wrong, and is also known as the god of goat. It is a symbol of bravery and justice as well as a symbol of justice of "upright and bright", "fair and fair" and "bright world".

> 獬豸拥有很高的智慧，懂人言知人性。它怒目圆睁，能辨是非曲直，能识善恶忠奸，发现奸邪的官员，就用角把他触倒，然后吃下肚子。它能辨曲直，又有神羊之称，它是勇猛、公正的象征，是司法“正大光明” “清平公正”“光明天下”的象征。
